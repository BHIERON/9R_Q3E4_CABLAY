			<p class="about"><b>SYPNOSIS:</b></p>
			<p>Jay Pritchett, a businessman, and his children, Claire and Mitchell, connect three distinct Los Angeles-area families in Modern Family.</p>

			<p>Fulgencio Joseph "Joe" Pritchett and Manuel "Manny" Delgado, a son from Gloria's previous marriage, were born to Jay and Gloria Delgado. Javier, Gloria's ex-husband, and DeDe, Jay's ex-wife occasionally appear on the program.</p>

			<p>Claire Dunphy is Jay's daughter and CEO of Pritchett's Closets and Blinds. She is married to Phil Dunphy, a real estate agent and "cool dad". They have three kids: Luke, Alex, and Haley. Dylan, Haley's on-again, off-again lover, is a constant on the show. They are married at the end of the tenth season.</p>

			<p>Mitchell and Cameron Tucker adopted their daughter Lily Tucker-Pritchett, a Vietnamese. In the series finale, they add Rexford to their family.</p>

			<p>The episodes are based on real-life events, depicting a modern family.</p>

						The oldest Dunphy kid is <b>Haley Gwendolyn</b>. She is a fashion designer as well as a college student. She is referred regarded as the Dunphy student who prefers partying and hanging out with friends than studying. Due to the fact that Haley is a teenager much like Claire, Claire is concerned about her safety. She quickly leaves for college but is later expelled due to underage drinking, refusing arrest, and unintentional attack on a police officer. She starts at a different university and is hired as a fashion designer. She had a sporadic connection with Dylan and is presently seeing Andy Bailey, Jay and Gloria's male nanny.
